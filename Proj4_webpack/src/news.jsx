                React.js is a JavaScript library that was created by Facebook. 
                It is often thought of as the “view” in a model-view-controller (MVC) user interface. 
                This makes sense when you consider the fact that the only function that must be 
                implemented in React is the “render” function. The render function provides the 
                output that the user sees (the “view”).
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default News;
